<h1>VLA - Legal aid checker</h1>
<h2>Status: Experiment</h2>
<p>This prototype is intended to how to aproach clients to the right matter</p>

<p>The code contained was adapted from UL Ministry of justice GitHub</p>
https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cla-can-you-get-legal-aid

<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>Using data-driven, user-centred, and iterative methods, we will work in short cycles called sprints. Sprints vary in length and outcome, and are defined as we go. We'll be talking with various stakeholders and using common design research methods such as journey mapping, developing personas, and creating case studies to better understand barriers for citizens, as well as legal aid employees. We'll be woring in the open--literally, we're sitting at a table on the 16th floor-- and sharing our methods with teams across legal aid. In addition, you can follow our progress and findings on our <a href="http://cfa-vla.tumblr.com/"><strong>team blog</strong></a> and at monthly open houses at the Code for Australia offices.
</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p> As described in the section above, we'll be working in an agile and iterative fashion, conisting of 1-4 week sprints over the course of our 6 months here. We will be regularly moving through a cycle of research, protoyping, and user testing--each cycle defined as we go. </p>
